    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to find the optimal portfolio combination of the following stocks:\n",
    "- RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc (RICK)\n",
    "- Philip Morris International (PM)\n",
    "- AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV)\n",
    "- Ferrari N.V. (RACE)\n",
    "- Las Vegas Sands (LVS)\n",
    "- Canopy Growth (CGC)\n",
    "- Tiffany & Co. (TIF)\n",
    "- Tesla Motors (TSLA)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal portfolio, we take an offset in Modern Portfolio Theory, finding the portfolio combination that bears the lowest risk i.e. the Minimum Variance Portolio (MVP).  To find the optimal portfolio, we furthermore make use of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which ultimately gives us the portfolio with the optimal ratio between expected return and risk i.e where we maximze the sharpe-ratio.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our model we make the following assumptions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Investors are rational and risk-averse. \n",
    "- Historical returns is representative for future returns.\n",
    "- Investors are price takers, meaning they cannot influence future prices.\n",
    "- No transaction cost\n",
    "- Investors can lend and borrow unlimited at the same risk free rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we assume 253 trading days a year, and look at data from january 1st 2010 untill january 1st 2020 to make our estimations. Therfore our results will be showing the optimal portfolio per January 1st 2020. "
