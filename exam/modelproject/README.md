# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The optimal portfolio** and is about finding the optimal portfolio with select stocks regards the risk-profile. The project finds a minimum variance portfolio for a risk adverse investor by minimizing the variance. The project also optimized the sharpe ratio to find the best risk-adjusted return to determine which portfolio a risk neutral investor would choose.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Final.ipynb](Final.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the Yahoo Finance package and Pandas Datareader package. They can be installed by inserting following:<br>
``pip install yfinance``<br>
``pip install pandas-datareader``
