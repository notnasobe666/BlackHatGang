Question 1

To solve the maximization problem given in equation 1, we define the variables, utility function labor supply, and set up our equilibrium of having consumption equal to total resources. We then maximize the utility function with respect to our constraints by printing the optimal labor supply, optimal consumption, and utility.

Question 2

To Plot l^* and c^* as a function of w in the range of 0.5 and 1.5, we set up a vector for w that assumes a uniform distribution between 0.5 and 1.5 with N = 10000. Secondly, we empty the lists for l and c and generate a loop to return the optimal level of consumption and labor supply given the wage.

Question 3

Total tax revenue is calculated and printed as a function of the number in the entire population and each individual in the population's tax revenue.

Question 4

We now change the Frisch elasticity of labor supply from 0.3 to 0.1 and print the new tax revenue using the same formula as created in question 3.

Question 5

To maximize the total tax revenue we define a vector that maximizes tax revenue, by finding new levels of $\tau_0$, $\tau_1$ & $\kappa$. We find the optimal tax level, which is found to be
