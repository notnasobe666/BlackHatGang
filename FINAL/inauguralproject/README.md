# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

This project examines the optimal level of taxation and tax cutoffs in a labour/consumption model using Python code. The model is simulated using the coded Python functions and assumptions given for a population of 10,000. The assumption about Frisch-elasticity is then lowered, which implies that the tax is less distortionary. Finally, the optimal level of taxation is found to be a standard tax of 78 pct. and a top tax of 54 pct. which is applied on incomes above 0.58.
