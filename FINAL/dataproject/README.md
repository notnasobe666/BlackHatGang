# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **BETTING ARBITRAGE 101** and is about historical returns on betting strategies for the English Premier League for the past 10 seasons. We investigate if there are any gains from betting solely on Away team wins, Draws, or Home team wins, we call these pure betting strategies. Firstly, we look at these pure betting strategies over the course of all 10 seasons and then we dive deeper into each individual season.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades one dataset**:

1. PL_all_seasons.csv downloaded from https://datahub.io/sports-data/english-premier-league

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install pandas``
``pip install datetime``
``pip install matplotlib.pyplot``
